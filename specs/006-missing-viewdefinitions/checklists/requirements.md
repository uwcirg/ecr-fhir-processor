# Specification Quality Checklist: ViewDefinitions for the Missing Persisted Resource Types

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The two scope-defining decisions (retire the misdirected `Measure` view + add a MeasureReport
  view; add a metadata-only Composition view) were resolved via the 2026-07-06 clarification
  session and encoded in FR-001/FR-002/FR-003 and the Assumptions — no open markers remain.
- Success criteria are stated as row-count / set-equality / null-vs-fabricated outcomes an analyst
  or reviewer can verify against a materialized server without inspecting implementation.
